# EnviroSound [1.7.10]
A Minecraft mod that provides realistic sound attenuation, reverberation, and absorption through blocks.
Previously known as Sound-Physics, I decided the name was a tad bland for what it did. I renamed it to mark my fork distictively, as any features I add may or may not work at all. :)

This is a fork of a fork of a fork! I forked it from AfterRebellion who forked it from Daipenger who forked it from SonicEther. Daipenger ported it to 1.12.2 and updated the mod, AfterRebellion just added some stuff & I've decided to improve it further while adding even more features.

# The stuff added in this fork  

## Alkalus  
* Support for all mods. (WIP)
* Further back ported fixes from 1.12+ releases.
* Cake!

## Other contributors  
* Dynamic environment evaluation (disabled by default, configured by in-game mod config)
* Automatic stereo to mono down-mixing of sounds.
* Basic compatibility with mods.
* Server support (right position for entity, computronics sounds and higher distance before sound cutoff)
