# Sound-Physics [1.7.10]
A Minecraft mod that provides realistic sound attenuation, reverberation, and absorption through blocks.

This is a fork of a fork of a fork! I forked it from AfterRebellion who forked it from Daipenger who forked it from SonicEther. Daipenger ported it to 1.12.2 and updated the mod, AfterRebellion just added some stuff & I've decided to improve it further while adding even more features.

# The stuff added in this fork  

## Alkalus  
* Support for all mods. (WIP)
* Further backported fixes from 1.12+ releases.
* Cake!

## Other contributors  
* Dynamic environement evaluation (disabled by default, enable in mod config ingame)
* Automatic stero to mono downmixing of sounds
* More compatibillity with mods (for now only computronics)
